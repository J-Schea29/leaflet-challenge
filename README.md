## Introduction
### Summary 
For this asignment, I had to create a map using Leaflet/Javascript that visualizes the earthquakes data from the [USGS (United States Geological Survey)](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) website. 
### Requirements
* Create a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from your data set based on their longitude and latitude.
* The data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and and depth of the earth quake by color.
* Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.
* Create a legend that will provide context for the map data.
### Bonus
* Add layer controls to map which alows one to select which map one wants to see.
